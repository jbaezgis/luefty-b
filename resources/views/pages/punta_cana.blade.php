  <p class="lead">Punta Cana, the easternmost tip of the Dominican Republic, abuts the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. It's a region known for its 32km stretch of beaches and clear waters. The BÃ¡varo area and Punta Cana combine to form what's known as La Costa del Coco, or the Coconut Coast, an area of lavish, all-inclusive resorts. It's popular for zip-lining, windsurfing, kayaking and sailing.</p>
